# aoe4-guides

Source code for [aoe4guides.com](https://aoe4guides.com): Yet another Age of Empires IV build order page to:
* create your own build orders (including video link, description, other meta information)
* share build orders with others
* browse and filter build orders
* (more to come: favorites, ratings, seasons, ...)

If you want to participate, some basic knowledge in the technology stack would be useful:
* Vue.js
* vuetify
* firebase (appcheck, auth, firestore)
* Vuex
* (maybe more)

Huge thanks to [Len](https://github.com/LENpolygon) who inspired me to start the project for fun. Just to learn Vue.js basics, use it for myself and overcome some
UX issues with other build order tools out there. :)
