# aoe4-guides | Your Home for Age of Empires IV Guides and Build Orders 

Source code for [aoe4guides.com](https://aoe4guides.com): Yet another Age of Empires IV build order page to:
* create your own build orders (including video link, description, other meta information)
* share build orders with others
* browse and filter build orders (e.g. by season or rating)
* manage your own favorite build orders
* write build order comments
* (more to come, some ideas: icon-based-builds, custom exports/imports, public api,...)

Goals:
* Build order central for Age of Empires IV/4
* Open and transparent
* Community driven
* Focus on good UX (snappy, easy-to-use, mobile-ready, discoverable...)

If you want to participate, some basic knowledge in the following technology stack would be useful:
* vue.js
* vuetify
* firebase (appcheck, auth, firestore)
* vuex
* (maybe more)

Huge thanks to [Len](https://github.com/LENpolygon) who inspired me to start the project for fun. Just to learn vue.js basics, to use it for myself and overcome some
UX issues with other build order tools out there. :)
